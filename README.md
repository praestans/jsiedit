Javascript In-Place Editor for Different Markup Languages

Full description in Russian language available here http://habrahabr.ru/post/166043/


Purpose
-------

Markup languages are widely spread: bbCodes, wiki markup, Markdown, HTML and others. But it is very inconvenient
to edit long texts, because you need to convert all the codes in your own head and imagine how it would look like.
At the same time you could find 'Preview' button to see formated text. And here comes a problem. You see a misprint
in preview mode and want to fix this typo, but needed to return to the text editor, find a corresponding place between
tags. Then press 'Preview' again to continue reading. Do you like it?

With jsiedit you could just select any block in preview mode, add, change or delete any text, and return to the reading.
It is very convinient and effective. No more long text in editors, only small pieces are edited, and you choose them yourself.
